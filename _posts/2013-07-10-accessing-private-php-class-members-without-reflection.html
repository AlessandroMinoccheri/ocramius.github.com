        <p>
            A couple of weeks ago I was working on a
            <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/issues/62" target="_blank">very tricky issue</a> on
            <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager" target="_blank">ProxyManager</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is simple: instantiating
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclass.php" target="_blank">ReflectionClass</a> or
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionproperty.php" target="_blank">ReflectionProperty</a> is
            slow, and by slow, I mean <strong>really slow!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to get some better performance, and the reason for that is that I'm trying to optimize a
            "<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/modules/zend.stdlib.hydrator.html" target="_blank">hydrator</a>"
            to work with larger data-sets by still keeping a low overhead.
        </p>

        <h4>PHP 5.4 to the rescue!</h4>

        <p>
            PHP 5.4 comes with a new API for Closures, which is
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/closure.bind.php" target="_blank"><code>Closure#bind()</code></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>Closure#bind()</code> basically allows you to get an instance of a closure with the scope of a given
            object or class. Neat! That's basically like adding APIs to existing objects!
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's break some OOP encapsulation to fit our needs!
        </p>

        <h4>Accessing private properties example</h4>

        <p>
            The techniques to access private members are actually already largely explained on the PHP manual, but
            I am going to make a simplified example anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's what you have to do to steal <code>Kitchen#yummy</code> from following object:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

class Kitchen
{
    private $yummy = 'cake';
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            First of all, let's define a closure to read the property as if we had access to it:
        </p>


{% highlight php %}<?php

$sweetsThief = function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen->yummy;
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Let's use it to steal some <code>yummy</code> stuff from the <code>Kitchen</code>:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Sadly, this <a href="http://3v4l.org/ET06l" target="_blank">will result</a> in <code>$sweetsThief</code>
            being caught with a fatal error that looks like following:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}Fatal error: Cannot access private property Kitchen::$yummy in [...] on line [...]{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Let's use <code>Closure#bind()</code> to make our thief smarter:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

// Closure::bind() actually creates a new instance of the closure
$sweetsThief = Closure::bind($sweetsThief, null, $kitchen);

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            <a href="http://3v4l.org/2E2mr" target="_blank">Success</a>! We can now get to the <code>cake</code>!
        </p>

        <h4>Changing closure scope vs. Reflection</h4>

        <p>
            How does this technique compare with <code>ReflectionProperty#getValue()</code>? Is it actually faster?
        </p>

        <p>
            At least from what reported by 3v4l.org, the performance of the <a href="" target="_blank">two</a>
            <a href="" target="_blank">scripts</a> is comparable.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've tweaked the test scripts to profile only the "setup" step for this trick over a million iterations:
        </p>

        {% highlight php %}<?php

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
        return $kitchen->yummy;
    }, null, 'Kitchen');
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
    $sweetsThief->setAccessible(true);
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Turns out that on my pc (PHP 5.4.9 ubuntu 13.04 box), the first script takes <code>~ 1.3</code> seconds
            to run, while the second one requires <code>~ 2.6</code> seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's completely un-interesting, since nobody will ever instantiate a million reflection properties
            if not completely insane.
        </p>

        <p>
            What is more interesting is how <strong>accessing properties</strong> compares. I've profiled that too:
        </p>


        {% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen->yummy;
}, null, 'Kitchen');

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief($kitchen);
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
$sweetsThief->setAccessible(true);

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief->getValue($kitchen);
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            I would actually have expected the reflection system being very slow in this case, but in fact it is much
            faster!
        </p>

        <p>
            The first script took <code>~ 3.4</code> seconds to run, while the second one just needed
            <code>~ 1.4</code> seconds!
        </p>

        <p>
            That basically tells us that the instantiation time of reflection classes is negligible, and that it's
            actually faster than userland code in accessing properties.
        </p>
