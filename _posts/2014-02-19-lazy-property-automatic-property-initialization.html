            Yesterday, I worked on yet another interesting little experiment, which is called
            <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty" target="_blank">
                LazyProperty
            </a>.
        </p>


        <h2>The problem with "lazy" properties</h2>

        <p>
            The idea is very simple: avoid manually checking object properties to see if they were initialized.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's make a simple example:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

class UserService
{
    // ... other fields ...
    protected $userRepository;

    public function register($user)
    {
        // ...
        $this->getUserRepository()->add($user);
        // ...
    }

    // ...

    protected function getUserRepository()
    {
        // we're not using DI here because of performance implication
        // normally, people use a service locator here for RAD
        return $this->userRepository
            ?: $this->userRepository = new MemoryUserRepository();
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

        <hr/>

        <p>
            This is fairly simple API, and it is perfectly fine to use it when we don't want to be forced
            to build the <code>MemoryUserRepository</code> instance for calls to API methods that don't use
            it.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a problem though, which is that any direct access to <code>UserService#$userRepository</code>
            has to be avoided: all of the class' implementation as well as its subclasses have to rely on the
            protected getter in order to access the repository instance.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, the following code works only because of a lucky combination of events:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

class UserService
{
    // ...
    protected $userValidator;

    public function register($user)
    {
        $this->getUserRepository()->add($user);
    }

    public function login($userId)
    {
        $this->userRepository->find($userId);
        // ...
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}<?php

$user = build_user_somehow();

$userService->register($user);
$userService->login($user->getId());{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            This code will run, but only because <code>UserService#register()</code> was called before
            <code>UserService#login()</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Possible solutions</h2>

        <p>
            The code in the examples exposes a silly bug, and it should be fixed by avoiding any property
            access to <code>UserService#$userRepository</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moreover, implementors of subclasses are also experiencing the issue if they try accessing the
            protected un-initialized property manually, but the fix for that is to just define
            <code>UserService#$userRepository</code> as <code>private</code> and being very defensive
            about its usage.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are all valid solutions, but we still don't get around using a protected getter in our
            class' scope.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's where I had this possibly crazy idea: making the property itself "lazy" and avoiding the
            getter call completely, making the getter an implementation detail.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's see how this is done with the library:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

class UserService
{
    use \LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait;

    protected $userRepository;

    public function __construct()
    {
        // ...
        $this->initLazyProperties(['userRepository']);
    }

    public function register($user)
    {
        // ...
        // now use the property directly
        $this->userRepository->add($user);
        // ...
    }

    public function login($userId)
    {
        $this->userRepository->find($userId);
        // ...
    }

    protected function getUserRepository()
    {
        return $this->userRepository
            ?: $this->userRepository = new MemoryUserRepository();
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            By calling <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#initLazyProperties()</code>, we've made sure
            that any access to the un-initialized <code>UserService#$userRepository</code> will actually
            trigger a call to <code>UserService#getUserRepository()</code>, and therefore initialize it.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that, we don't need to actually worry about calling the getter: both the getter call and
            property access will work the same way, which is pretty cool!
        </p>

        <h2>Under the hood</h2>

        <p>
            So what is going on? I'm simply exploiting an feature of the PHP language on which I've already
            blogged at <a href="http://ocramius.github.io/blog/intercepting-public-property-access-in-php/" target="_blank">
                Property Accessors in PHP Userland
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a reference, here is the annotated body of <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty/blob/fe60bd66455b6acf34fe0be25a83a625db6b2f88/src/LazyProperty/LazyPropertiesTrait.php#L37-L58">
                <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#initLazyProperties()</code>
            </a>:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

private function initLazyProperties(array $lazyPropertyNames, $checkLazyGetters = true)
{
    foreach ($lazyPropertyNames as $lazyProperty) {

        // verify that a getter is available for the given lazy property
        if ($checkLazyGetters && ! method_exists($this, 'get' . $lazyProperty)) {
            throw MissingLazyPropertyGetterException::fromGetter($this, 'get' . $lazyProperty, $lazyProperty);
        }

        // record the properties that were defined as "lazy"
        $this->lazyPropertyAccessors[$lazyProperty] = false;

        // if the property is defined, then ignore it (we don't want to alter object state)
        if (! isset($this->$lazyProperty)) {
            // unset the property, this allows us to use magic getters
            unset($this->$lazyProperty);
        }
    }
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Quite simple! Nothing really incredible going on here. When is the property actually initialized?
        </p>

        <p>
            The other method defined by the trait is the <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty/blob/fe60bd66455b6acf34fe0be25a83a625db6b2f88/src/LazyProperty/LazyPropertiesTrait.php#L60-L84">
                Magic getter <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#__get()</code>
            </a>:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

// returning a reference is required,
// otherwise (for example) array properties accessed for writes will fail
public function & __get($name)
{
    // disallow access to non-existing properties
    if (! isset($this->lazyPropertyAccessors[$name])) {
        throw InvalidLazyProperty::nonExistingLazyProperty($this, $name);
    }

    // retrieve the object that is trying to access the lazy property
    $caller = debug_backtrace(DEBUG_BACKTRACE_PROVIDE_OBJECT)[1];

    // disallow access from invalid scope
    // basically reproduces property visibility in userland
    if (! isset($caller['object']) || $caller['object'] !== $this) {
        AccessScopeChecker::checkCallerScope($caller, $this, $name);
    }

    // set the property to `null` (disables notices)
    $this->$name = null;

    // initialize the property
    $this->$name = $this->{'get' . $name}();

    return $this->$name;
}{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>
        This "hack" is simple, clean, easily tested and doesn't cause any problems.
        It works on PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and even on HHVM, which I wasn't expecting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Should you use it? Yes, why not?
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you need it? Usually not: being defensive about usage of your APIs can actually avoid
        sloppy mistakes like the ones that I've described in the examples.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clean dependency injection and eventually proxying dependencies produces better results than
        explicit lazy-loading coded in your classes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most interesting thing in this experiment is that PHP yet again allows to implement
        language-level features in userland, which is awesome!
