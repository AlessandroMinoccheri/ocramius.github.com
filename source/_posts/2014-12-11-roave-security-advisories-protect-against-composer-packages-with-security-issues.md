    Since it's almost christmas, it's also time to release a new project that I've been 
    thinking of for quite some time.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://twitter.com/RoaveTeam" target="_blank">Roave Team</a> is pleased to announce the release of
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">roave/security-advisories</a>, a package
    that keeps known security issues out of your project.
