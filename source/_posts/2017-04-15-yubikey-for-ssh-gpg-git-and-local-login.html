<p>
    I've been using a
    <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/" target="_blank">
        YubiKey Neo
    </a>
    for a bit over two years now, but its usage was limited to
    <abbr title="Two Factor Authentication">2FA</abbr>
    and
    <abbr title="Universal Two Factor Authentication">U2F</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
    Last week, I received my new DELL XPS 15 9560, and since I am maintaining
    some high impact open source projects, I wanted the setup to be well secured.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to that, I caught a bad flu, and that gave me enough excuses
    to waste time in figuring things out.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, I'm going to describe what I did, and how you can reproduce
    my setup for your own safety, and for the safety of people that trust what you do.
</p>

<h2>Yubi-WHAT?</h2>

<p>
    In first place, you should know that I am absolutely not a security expert:
    all I did was following the online tutorials that I found.
    I also am not a cryptography expert, and I am constantly dissatisfied with
    how the crypto community reduces everything into a
    <abbr title="Three Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>,
    making even the simplest things impossible to understand for mere mortals.
</p>

<p>
    First, let's clarify what a YubiKey is.
</p>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2017-04-15-yubikey-for-ssh-gpg-git-and-local-login/yoshi-yubikey.jpg"
        alt="A YubiKey Neo on a cat"
    />
</p>

<p>
    That thing is a YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    What does it do?
</p>

<p>
    It's basically an USB key filled with crypto features.
    It also is (currently) impossible to make a physical copy of it,
    and it is not possible to extract information written to it.
</p>

<p>
    It can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Generate
        <abbr title="Hash Message Authentication Code">HMAC</abbr>
        hashes (kinda)
    </li>
    <li>
        Store
        <abbr title="Gnu Privacy Guard">GPG</abbr>
        private keys
    </li>
    <li>Act as a keyboard that generates time-based passwords</li>
    <li>Generate 2FA time-based login codes</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>
    In order to follow this tutorial, you should have at least
    2 (two) YubiKey Neo or equivalent devices. This means that
    you will have to spend approximately USD 100: these things
    are quite expensive. You absolutely need a backup key,
    because all these security measures may lock you out of
    your systems if you lose or damage a YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    Our kickass setup will allow us to do a series of cool
    things related to daily development operations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Two Factor Authentication</li>
    <li>PAM Authentication (logging into your linux/mac PC)</li>
    <li>GPG mail and GIT commit signing/encrypting</li>
    <li>SSH Authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>

        alt="Covered YubiKey features"
    />
</p>

<p>
    I am not going to describe the procedures in detail,
    but just link them and describe what we are doing, and
    why.
</p>

<h2>Setting up NFC 2FA</h2>

<p>
    Simple NFC-based 2FA with authentication codes will
    be useful for most readers, even non-technical ones.
</p>

<p>
    What we are doing is simply seed the YubiKey with
    Google Authenticator codes, except that we will
    use the
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yubico.yubioath&hl=en" target="_blank">
        Yubico Authenticator
    </a>.
    This will only work for the "primary" key (the one
    we will likely bring with us).
</p>

<p>
    What you will have to do is basically:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install some Yubico utility to manage your Yubikey NEO</li>
    <li>
        Plug in your YubiKey and enable
        <abbr title="One Time Password">OTP</abbr>
        and U2F
    </li>
    <li>Install the Yubico Authenticator</li>
    <li>Seed your Yubikey with the 2FA code provided by a compatible website</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The setup steps are described in the official
    <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/how-to-use-your-yubikey-with-authenticator-codes/" target="_blank">
        Yubico website
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    Once you configured your YubiKey with at least one
    <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/" target="_blank">
        website
    </a>
    that supports the "Google Authenticator" workflow,
    you should be able to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the Yubico Authenticator</li>
    <li>Tap your YubiKey against your phone's NFC sensor</li>
    <li>Use the generated authentication code</li>
</ol>

<p>
    One very nice (and unclear, at first) advantage of
    having your YubiKey seeded with 2FA codes is that
    you can now generate 2FA codes on any phone, as long
    as you have your YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    I already had to remote-lock and remote-erase a phone
    in the past, and losing the Google Authenticator settings
    is not fun. If you handle your YubiKey with care, you
    shouldn't have that problem anymore.
</p>

<p>
    Also, a YubiKey is water-proof: your 2017 phone probably isn't.
</p>

<h2>Setting up PAM authentication</h2>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> this procedure
    can potentially lead you to lose access to <code>sudo</code>
    access from your account, as well as lock you out of your account.
    I take no responsibility: try it in a
    <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>
    first, if you do not feel confident.
</p>

<p>
    We want to make sure that we can log into our personal
    computer or workstation only when we are physically sitting
    at it. This means that we need the YubiKey must be plugged
    in for a password authentication to succeed.
</p>

<p>
    Each login prompt, user password prompt or <code>sudo</code>
    command should require both our account password and our YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    What you will have to do is basically:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install <code>libpam-yubico</code></li>
    <li>
        Enable some capabilities of your YubiKeys with
        <code>ykpersonalize</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate an initial challenge file for each YubiKey (you
        bought at least 2, right?) with
        <code>ykpamcfg</code>
    </li>
    <li>Deploy the generated files in a root-only accessible path</li>
    <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">IMPORTANT</span>
        start a
        <code>sudo</code>
        session, and be ready to revert changes from there
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure
        <abbr title="Pluggable Authentication Modules">PAM</abbr>
        to also expect a challenge response from a YubiKey (reads:
        a recognized YubiKey must be plugged in when trying to
        authenticate)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The steps to perform that are
    <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html" target="_blank">
        in the official Yubico tutorial
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    If everything is done correctly, every prompt asking for your
    Linux/Mac account password should fail when no YubiKey is plugged
    in.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">TIP:</span> configure the
    libpam-yubico integration in debug mode, as you will often
    have a "WTH?" reaction when authentication isn't working.
    That may happen if there are communication errors with the
    YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    This setup has the advantage of locking out anyone trying to
    bruteforce your password, as well as stopping potentially malicious
    background programs from performing authentication or
    <code>sudo</code>
    commands while you aren't watching.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> the point
    of this sort of setup is to guarantee that login can only
    happen with the physical person at the computer. If you want
    to go to the crapper, lock your computer, and bring your
    YubiKey with you.
</p>

<h2>Setting up GPG</h2>

<p>
    This is probably the messiest part of the setup, as a lot of
    CLI tool usage is required.
</p>

<p>
    Each YubiKey has the ability to store 3 separate keys for
    <i>signing</i>, <i>encrypting</i> and <i>authenticating</i>.
</p>

<p>
    We will therefore create a series of GPG keys:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>A GPG master key (if you don't already have a GPG key)</li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for signing (marked
        <code>[S]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for encrypting (marked
        <code>[E]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for authenticating (marked
        <code>[A]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate these 3 sub-keys for each YubiKey
        you have (3 keys per YubiKey)
    </li>
</ol>
