    I've been using a
    <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/" target="_blank">
        YubiKey Neo
    </a>
    for a bit over two years now, but its usage was limited to
    <abbr title="Two Factor Authentication">2FA</abbr>
    and

    how the crypto community reduces everything into a

    making even the simplest things impossible to understand for mere mortals.
